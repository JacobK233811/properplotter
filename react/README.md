## Development

We are using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to run a React frontend with TypeScript and TailWind CSS. Follow the _setup_ script, to install _nvm_ and _yarn_ and make sure you run `yarn` to install all required packages. Then to start the App:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.
After changes make sure to run `prettier` or enable it on saving in your IDE.
